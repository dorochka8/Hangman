# Please, don't hang me, Hangman!

I propose to use my source code to create your own Hangman game Bot written on telebot. Downbelow is a simple instruction to do in a few steps.

# Creating your Application

1. [**Obtain your own token to access the HTTP API**](https://t.me/BotFather) for your bot.
2. Please **do use** an individual file for your bot-token (`config.py`).
3. Kindly **do use** the `telebot` library for telegram bot and `python` for coding.
# Guide

1. Clone the project from GitHub (*Windows compatibility*):
```
git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/LaDoring/Hangman
```
2. Install `requirements.txt` (directly from https://github.com/LaDoring/Hangman/blob/main/requirements.txt to get all the libraries that are used in the project, *VS Code compatibility*).
3. Adjust configuration parameters:
- Modify the values in `config.py`
4. (Optional) Change the words you want to send to player in `words.py`.
5. Start your Bot with running the `main.py` file.
